Add a search form based on Wordpress fields in posts list


== Description ==

Advanced Post Search is a WordPress plugin for anyone who needs an advanced search for posts (or custom posts) in WordPress admin.
Easily find posts by performing complex queries directly from the posts list and using specific filters for each field. It works with any post type and custom post type.

Advanced Post Search lets you search posts by any post attribute; search by:

* Post Title
* Post Content
* Post Publish (date or date interval)
* Post Last Modified (date or date interval)
* Post Status
* Post Password
* Post Author
* Post Excerpt
* Post Slug

Specify which comparison operator you want to use; each field has its own comparison operators, according to the field type: for example, in `text` fields you can perform a `strict` or a `like` search.

You can manage search preferences from `Advanced Post Search Â» Views` in order to show/hide any search field for each post type.
